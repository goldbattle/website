	description  = {In this paper we propose a new analytical preintegration theory for graph-based sensor fusion with an inertial measurement unit (IMU) and a camera (or other aiding sensors).Rather than using discrete sampling of the measurement dynamics as in current methods,we derive the closed-form solutions to the preintegration equations, yielding improved accuracy in state estimation.We advocate two new different inertial models for preintegration: (i) the model that assumes piecewise constant measurements, and (ii) the model that assumes piecewise constant local true acceleration.}
